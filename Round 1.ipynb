        "It seems upside-down, but if we want to sort by score and then break ties by name, we sort by name first, then by score. Why this works: the sort function in Python is **stable**, meaning, if two items are tied according to the comparison rule/key function we provided, their *relative* order is left unchanged. Of the two tied items, the item that came first before sorting still comes first after sorting. In our solution, this means that if there are ties while sorting by score, the tied items will be left in the order they had before sorting by score, in other words, ties become sorted by name."

For example, sorting by score is $O(n \\log n)$ because comparing two numbers happens instantly. On the other hand, sorting by name is $O(n \\log n S)$, where $S$ is the maximum length of one string. You don't have to understand why it is $O(n \\log nT)$ for now, but you can already use this fact to estimate the efficiency of your own programs, if they use the sort function. Take note! Just because the syntax is short, doesn't mean it translates into a small constant number of CPU operations. Behind the scenes, those built-in functions can have loops and stuff inside."

        "The reason why this is faster: behind the scenes, dictionaries are just arrays/lists. When you tell Python to insert a **key-value pair** in the dictionary, it first converts the key into a number, then puts the value in that position in the list. When you tell Python to get the value associated with a key, it also first converts the key into a number, then accesses that position in the list. There is no loop that compares the key with every item in the dictionary one-by-one.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the \"expensive\" operations that Python needs to do is converting a key to a number, and this is about (length of the key) operations for string keys, which is not really that expensive if the strings are short. What might make dictionary operations slow is **collisions**: because keys are converted to numbers basically randomly, it might happen that two different keys get converted to the same position. There are ways to deal with this. They make dictionaries slightly slower than plain list indexing, but usually still much better than for-looping through a list of items, one item at a time.\n",
